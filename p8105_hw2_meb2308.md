# Problem 1

### Import Mr. Trash Wheel data

First, I will specify the Mr. Trash Wheel Excel data sheet and omit
non-data entries, including rows and columns with notes and figures. I
will also create new variable names.

Now I’ll round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and
conver the results to an integer variable.

I’ll also read and clean the precipitation data for 2017 and 2018,
omitting rows without data and adding a variable for year.

I will combine the precipitation datasets and convert month to a
character variable using month.name.
