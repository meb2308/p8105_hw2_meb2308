This homework uses r version 4.0.2 and r studio version 1.3.1073.

For this homework, I need the tidyverse and readxl libraries.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

# Problem 1

### Read and clean Mr. Trash Wheel data

First, I will read the Mr. Trash Wheel Excel data sheet, create snake
format variable names, and omit non-data entries, including rows and
columns with notes and figures, as well as entries that are unrelated to
the dumpster data.

I’ll also round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and
convert the results to an integer variable.

``` r
trashwheel_df =
  read_xlsx("./data/trash_wheel.xlsx",
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor:: clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  ) 
```

### Read and clean precipitation data

Next, I’ll read and clean the precipitation data for 2017 and 2018,
omitting rows without data and adding a variable for year.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel("./data/trash_wheel.xlsx",
      sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
      skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor:: clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel("./data/trash_wheel.xlsx",
      sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
      skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor:: clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Now I will combine the precipitation datasets and convert month to a
character variable using month.name.

``` r
precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

The square bracket vector is not ideal, so we can create a month data
frame instead.

``` r
options(tibble.print_min = 3)

month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##    year month total month_name
    ##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ## 1  2017     1  2.34 January   
    ## 2  2017     2  1.46 February  
    ## 3  2017     3  3.57 March     
    ## # … with 21 more rows

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel collector in
Baltimore, MD. As trash enters the inner harbor, the trashwheel collects
the trasha and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset contains information
on year, month, weight of the trash collected, and the number of some
specific types of trash, such as plastic bottles. There are 344 rows in
our final dataset. Additional data sheets include monthly precipitation
data.

This code can be used with the 2020 data, because the sheet names are
consistent\!

# Problem 2

### Read and clean the NYC Transit dataset

I will read and clean the NYC transit dataset, keeping important
variables.

``` r
options(tibble.print_min = 3)

subway_df =
  read_csv("./data/subway.csv", 
    col_types = "cccnnccccccccccccccccclclcccnncc") %>%
  janitor:: clean_names() %>%
  select(
      line, station_name, station_location, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, vending, entry, entrance_type, ada)

subway_tidy_data = 
  pivot_longer(
    subway_df,
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_order",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route") %>%
  drop_na(route)

subway_tidy_data
```

    ## # A tibble: 4,270 x 9
    ##   line  station_name station_location vending entry entrance_type ada  
    ##   <chr> <chr>        <chr>            <chr>   <chr> <chr>         <lgl>
    ## 1 4 Av… 25th St      (40.660397, -73… YES     YES   Stair         FALSE
    ## 2 4 Av… 25th St      (40.660397, -73… YES     YES   Stair         FALSE
    ## 3 4 Av… 36th St      (40.655144, -74… YES     YES   Stair         FALSE
    ## # … with 4,267 more rows, and 2 more variables: route_order <chr>, route <chr>

I then converted the entry variable from a character to a logical
variable.

``` r
as.logical(pull(subway_tidy_data, entry))
```

This dataset contains information about the NYC transit systems’ subway
stations. I cleaned the dataset so that variable names are in snake
format and only retained information on the station names and locations,
the routes that are served by each station during weekday service,
whether the location allows entry, the entrance type, whether vending
machines are available, and whether it is ADA accessible. I tidied the
data so that routes 1 through 11 were listed in a single column rather
than 11 columns and rows with NA are removed. I then converted entry
from a character to a logical vector. There are 1868 rows and 18 in the
final dataset. I consider the data to be tidy.
