This homework uses r version 4.0.2 and r studio version 1.3.1073.

```

# Problem 1

### Read and clean Mr. Trash Wheel data

First, I will read the Mr. Trash Wheel Excel data sheet, create snake
format variable names, and omit non-data entries, including rows and
columns with notes and figures, as well as entries that are unrelated to
the dumpster data.

I’ll also round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and
convert the results to an integer variable.

``` r
trashwheel_df =
  read_xlsx("./data/trash_wheel.xlsx",
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor:: clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  ) 
```

### Read and clean precipitation data

Next, I’ll read and clean the precipitation data for 2017 and 2018,
omitting rows without data and adding a variable for year.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel("./data/trash_wheel.xlsx",
      sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
      skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor:: clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel("./data/trash_wheel.xlsx",
      sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
      skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor:: clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Now I will combine the precipitation datasets and convert month to a
character variable using month.name.

``` r
precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

The square bracket vector is not ideal, so we can create a month data
frame instead.

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2017     1  2.34 January   
    ##  2  2017     2  1.46 February  
    ##  3  2017     3  3.57 March     
    ##  4  2017     4  3.99 April     
    ##  5  2017     5  5.64 May       
    ##  6  2017     6  1.4  June      
    ##  7  2017     7  7.09 July      
    ##  8  2017     8  4.44 August    
    ##  9  2017     9  1.95 September 
    ## 10  2017    10  0    October   
    ## # … with 14 more rows

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel collector in
Baltimore, MD. As trash enters the inner harbor, the trashwheel collects
the trasha and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset contains information
on year, month, weight of the trash collected, and the number of some
specific types of trash, such as plastic bottles. There are \`r
nrows(trashwheel\_df) rows in our final dataset. Additional data sheets
include monthly precipitation data.
